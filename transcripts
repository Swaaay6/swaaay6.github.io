My name is Cedrick Maurice Allbritton. I love playing sports. I enjoy playing basketball, baseball, and running track.  I love to go mud riding and playing the drums.I love cars. One day, I hope to own my own foreign car dealership. My career goal is to become a petroleum engineer and go out and find different spots where oil can produced. I also plan on attending Mississippi State University to pursue my major in Petroleum Engineering.
